In this project I am building a calculator that could be used on the browser, this project was for checking my skills on
javascript. It was really challenging as I had to google a lot and search sum of the information I needed to make my 
calculator functional. But at the same time I had a lot of fun building something so functional and practical.
This calculator project was part of the Odin Project curriculum assignments which is an online tutorial aiming to take one
from a learner to a fullstack developer, I have been following along their course and building projects. Although I am still
learning but I am proud of the progress I am making. I have attached a link for the live project and my github repositories.
